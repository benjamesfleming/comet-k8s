# Hosted Comet Chart
# This is used to configure a hosted comet region. It will configure the DNS (with failover), Hosted Servers, Storage Volumes, and
# link them together using a StatefulSet to ensure only one server configuration is ever availible on a given hostname
#
# DNS:
#   The controller will configure DnsEndpoints using the external-dns package (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns).
#   And will be responsible from creating and maintaining the following records.
#
#   A     <region>.<hostedZone>.                        ->  <nodes-external-ip-list>
#   CNAME <region><ordinal-to-letter>.<hostedZone>.     ->  <region>.<hostedZone>.
#   CNAME *.<region><ordinal-to-letter>.<hostedZone>.   ->  <region>.<hostedZone>.
# 
#   A     us-east-1.offsitenetwork.net.    ->  54.163.205.71,34.228.200.9754.242.170.183
#   CNAME us-east-1a.offsitenetwork.net.   ->  us-east-1.offsitenetwork.net.
#   CNAME *.us-east-1a.offsitenetwork.net. ->  us-east-1.offsitenetwork.net.
#
# TRAEFIK:
#   A custom traefik ingrees route can take over once the request has made it to a host, mapping the hostname to 
#   the correct stateful pod.
#
#   Host(`us-east-1a.offsitenetwork.net`, `*.us-east-1a.offsitenetwork.net`) -> hosted-comet-0.hosted-comet.svc.cluster.local
#   Host(`us-east-1b.offsitenetwork.net`, `*.us-east-1b.offsitenetwork.net`) -> hosted-comet-1.hosted-comet.svc.cluster.local
#
# LIMITATIONS:
#   1. There is no external load balancer (elbv2). This could create an extra hop for client connection. 
#      User -> Host1 -> Ingress (traefik) -> ServiceMesh (flannel) -> Host2 -> Pod -> Comet Server
#   2. The initial failover after a host failure might be slow, and relies on the client performing DNS Failover.
#   3. ...

---
# Number of replicas the controller should deploy.
# This maps directly to a StatefulSet with a matching number of replicas. Using replicas=3 will produce:
#   us-east-1{a,b,c}.offsitenetwork.net
replicas: 3
